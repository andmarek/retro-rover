# General
- Need to formalize comments vs cards. Let's call them cards maybe because that is more generic and perhaps in the future they might not be cards?

# /boards
- What does the green dot represent? We should remove it if we don't know what it is. I think it is active, but what does that mean?
- Do we need to align the board features? Probably.
- We should make the board titles links to the board

# /boards/<board_id>
- [x] - Make the columns dynamic. Right now they are hardcoded
- [x] - Add navbar for navigation
    - Right now, there's no way to get back to the boards page or the home page
- [ ] -  Adding card should we smoother. I want to add an animation so that adding card looks frictionless. Imagine adding a card, and then it doesn't "move" or anything, the only thing that moves is the "Add card" portion.
- [x] - Make cards draggable
- Make it so that you cannot give a card infinite likes. Make like system. Each user has X amount of likes to give.
- Glitchy liking cards. The cards.. move?
- Make navbar not look like shit
