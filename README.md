# RetroRover
RetroRover is a free, open-source, and self-hosteable retrospective board application. The idea came about when I was running Agile(tm) retrospective for my team and particular retro sites that I was using became pay-to-play or had severely limited functionality. I realized I could create my own version that functioned better!
